# Frontend Digital Cockpit — Docs

Welcome to the quick developer documentation for the Frontend Digital Cockpit.

- See `getting-started.md` for bootstrapping the project locally.
- See `last-commit.md` for the automated commit metadata process.

This `docs/` folder is intentionally small and intended to grow as the project
adopts a more formal docs site.
